# Rails-Pinterest-Clone

Created using ruby on rails, this is a project that clones the early version of pinterest, it was created with the sole purpose of training on the rails platform, working with scaffolding and more rails features. This is kind of outdated, but it is a good example on using login and sign up mechanisms, as well as using amazon web services for storing and retrieving photos.
